		    CLAWS MAIL  RELEASE NOTES
                    http://www.claws-mail.org
		      
Claws Mail is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast 
email client.

New in this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The TAB address completion in the Compose window now matches any
  part of the address and not just the beginning.

* When copying or moving a message, the type-ahead search now matches
  any part of a folder name and not just the beginning.

* It is now possible to replace the current signature in the Compose
  window by using the '/Message/Replace signature' menu item.

* It is now possible to disable the 'Subject is empty' warning
  dialogue. See the option 'Warn when Subject is empty' option on the
  '/Configuration/Preferences/Mail handling/Sending' page.
  
* When sending messages, if the hostname cannot be determined,
  fallback to 'localhost' rather than 'unknown', as the latter is
  rejected by some servers.

* Added better handling of messages from broken mailers, such as
  yahoo groups.

* PDF plugin: the minimum required version of poppler is 0.12.0.

* PGP/* plugin: long key IDs are now displayed in the dialogues
  instead of short IDs.

* PGP/* plugin: The automatic signature check is now non-blocking.

* Python plugin: can now access accounts, mailboxes, folder
  properties

* vCalendar plugin: webcals:// URLs are now treated as https://

* Translation updates: Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, French,
  German, Hebrew, Slovak, Spanish, and Swedish.

* Support for Maemo has been removed.
