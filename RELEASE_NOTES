Claws Mail is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* When attaching files with no suffix, e.g. Makefile, the correct
  mime type is now found.

* Added support for a whole range of extra TLDs.

* '➜' is used instead of '-->' in the Message List when sender is
  yourself. (Only visible if the hidden pref 'enable_swap_from' is
  set to 0.)

* An external editor can now be embedded in the Compose window.
  This depends upon the 'Text editor' option (/Configuration/
  Preferences/Message View/External Programs) having a suitable
  value, such as 'gvim -f --socketid %w %s'.

* Address Book: address books can now be searched.

* A hidden pref has been added, 'next_on_delete'. This controls the
  message selection when a message is deleted. A setting of '0'
  which cause the previous, older message to be selected, a setting
  of '1' will cause the next, newer message to be selected.

* PDF Viewer plugin: Support for encrypted (password protected) PDFs.

* RSSyl plugin: The feed preferences window appearance has been
  improved.

* The --enable-new-addrbook configure option has been renamed to
  --enable-alternate-addressbook.
