		    CLAWS MAIL  RELEASE NOTES
                    http://www.claws-mail.org

Claws Mail is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast 
email client.

New in this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Preferences are now saved to disk immediately on pressing OK or
  Apply.

* New preferences have been added for default sorting of the message
  lists. They are found in the 'Message list' frame of the Display/
  Summaries page of the general preferences. These options only apply
  to newly created folders.

* The menu item 'Delete thread' has been moved to the Message menu.
  Previously clicking it would not delete the thread, but just move
  it to the Trash folder. Now it will delete the thread.
  An additional menu item has been added, 'Move thread to trash',
  which implements the original behaviour.

* Compose window: By default it is no longer possible to add user-
  defined headers, with only those pre-defined in the drop down menus
  being possible. To restore the old behaviour, a new hidden
  preference has been added: 'type_any_header', setting this to 1
  restores the old behaviour.

* Automatic account selection is now also applied when you reply to
  one of your own messages, e.g. from the Sent folder.

* Folder list: The Left and Right cursor keys now collapse or expand
  the currently selected folder tree item. The Left cursor key also
  moves the selection to parent folder, if current folder is within
  a collapsed tree.

* Folder list: The Home and End keys now move the selection to the
  first folder and last folder in the tree.

* Account Auto-configuration: when errors occur, a more detailed
  error message is shown.

* GnuPG plugins: An option has been added to specify the location of
  the GnuPG executable.

* GnuPG plugins: A new hidden preference has been added which limits
  the number of results returned when using your keyring for address
  auto-completion: 'autocompletion_limit'. The default value is 0,
  which means there is no limit, any other number will limit the
  results to that number.

* Python plugin: Folder has been added to MessageInfo objects.

* The GeoLocation plugin is no longer included.

* The user manual has been updated.

* The man page has been updated.

* Updated translations: Brazilian Portuguese, British English, Czech,
  Dutch, Finnish, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Norwegian Bokm√•l,
  Slovak, Spanish, Swedish.

* New translations: Italian, Traditional Chinese.

* Removed translations:  Indonesian, Polish.
