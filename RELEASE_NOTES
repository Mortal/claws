		    CLAWS MAIL  RELEASE NOTES
                    http://www.claws-mail.org

Claws Mail is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast 
email client.

New in this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Complete SSL certificate chains are now saved, and if built with
  Libetpan 1.4.1, the IMAP SSL connection's certificate chain is made
  available. Both of these allow correct certificate verification
  instead of a bogus 'No certificate issuer found' status.

* Auto-configuration of account email servers, based on SRV records,
  is now possible. (GLib >= 2.22 is required.)

* Added a preference to avoid automatically drafting emails that are
  to be sent encrypted, (Configuration/Preferences/Compose/Writing).

* Messages saved as Drafts are now saved as New, highlighting the
  Drafts folder, in order to draw the attention to unfinished mails
  there.

* It is now possible to add a 'Replace signature' button to the
  Compose window toolbar.

* Quotation wrapping and undo/redo in the Compose window has been
  improved.

* 'Reply to all' now excludes your own address.

* The 'Generate X-Mailer header' option has been renamed 'Add user
  agent header' and applies to both X-Mailer and X-Newsreader
  headers.

* Added hidden preferences, 'address_search_wildcard' and 
  'folder_search_wildcard', to choose between matching from start of
  the folder name/address or any part of the name. (Activating these
  options restores the previous behaviour.)

* Added hidden preference 'enable_avatars' to control the internal
  capture/render process, and which allows disabling it by external
  plugins for example.

* 'Check for new folders' now only updates the folder list, not
  updating the contents of folders. If needed, it can be followed by
  'Check for new messages'
  
* When using Redirect, the redirecting account's address is used in
  the SMTP MAIL FROM instead of the original sender's address.

* NEW: Libravatar plugin, which displays avatars from
  https://www.libravatar.org/

* Added support for an arbitrary number and sources of 'avatars' and
  images for email senders, and migrated Face and X-Face headers.

* Avatars are now included when printing mails.

* The GPG keyring can now be used as the source for address auto-
  completion.

* The vCalendar and RSSyl plugins now have an option to disable SSL
  certificate verification (and check them by default).

* The ClamAV plugin now pops up an error message only once instead of
  repeatedly

* Updated the man page and the manual.

* Updated Brazilian Portuguese, British English, Czech, Dutch,
  Finnish, French, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Lithuanian, Slovak,
  Spanish, and Swedish translations.

* Added Esperanto translation.
