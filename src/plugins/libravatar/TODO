Enhancements, possibilities and random ideas
--------------------------------------------

- Retrieve federated domain records (!)
- Support federated IDN domains (??) (Claws Mail itself doesn't support it
  http://www.thewildbeast.co.uk/claws-mail/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1670)
- Domain validation when searching for federated avatars, or at least
  exclude some domains (eg.: localhost) (???)
- Check box to enable/disable domain validation (?)
  http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt may be useful.
- Button for checking custom default URL is not 404 (!) check on apply (?)
- Make it run in cache-less mode if cache dir cannot be created (??)
- Only cache "mystery man" once for all hashes (what if changes) (?)
- Cache information label (size on disk/# of avatars/missing cached) (?)
- Empty avatar/missing cache button(s) (?)
- Run network retrieval in a separate thread started at header capture
  hook (??)
- Alternate proxy support (send avatar requests through a proxy which
  is not the one in http_proxy environment variable) (??)
- Limit avatar download size (??) or time (???)
- Configure missing factor/time separately (??)

As these are already known, please do not request enhancement bugs for any
of the above unless you have a working patch to be attached to the bug ;-)

Discussion on ML is welcome, specially for items with one or more question
marks.
