- enable recursive behavior. Since filenames are not unique outside of a
folder item this will require a lot of code.
- use claws' built-in quick search. Add button to create a virtual folder
using the result of search. Since quick search has the ability to make recursive
searches this wish depends on whether recursive behavior is implemented
in the VFolder plugin.
- add 'Create virtual folder' to main context menu.
