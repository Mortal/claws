Building Claws Mail with JHBuild
--------------------------------

Claws Mail can be built with JHBuild. This way, it's easy to do
sandboxed builds, for example in order to try out different versions
of low-level dependencies like gtk+ or glib without messing up a production
system. It's also useful to build older dependencies that are otherwise hard
to get on a more recent distribution.

In order to use JHBuild for building Claws Mail, first, JHBuild itself
must be built and installed, see
https://developer.gnome.org/jhbuild/stable/getting-started.html

JHBuild needs a configuration file, either as ~/.jhbuildrc or given with the
parameter -f on the command line. You can use the file
sample.jhbuildrc-claws-mail as a starting point, but you'll have to modify
it to suit your local environment.
